# General Information

The goal of this interest group is to facilitate responsible forms of participation in data science. A fundamental step in this achieving this goal is to increase awareness of key ethical and social issues and to build data literacy so that all individuals can engage in projects that matter to them.

Therefore, we run a series of events that are either open to our group members—you can sign-up here—as well as events that are open to anyone.
