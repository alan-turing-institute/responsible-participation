# Case Studies

Our interest group members carry out a range of public engagement activities for other projects they are involved with. The following is a list of case studies they have developed for some of these projects, which can be used and adapted for your own public engagement.

## Trustworthy Digital Mental Healthcare

The following case studies were developed as part of the Trustworthy Assurance in Digital Mental Healthcare project, funded by the UKRI's Trustworthy Autonomous Systems Hub.

    2. [App Limits](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/responsible-participation/raw/master/docs/assets/case-studies/app-limits.pdf)–a smartphone app that automates access to apps (e.g. for gambling) to support vulnerable users
    3. [Risk Assessment](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/responsible-participation/raw/master/docs/assets/case-studies/risk-assessment.pdf) Algorithm–an algorithmic system that is used to monitor peer to peer support forums to identify "at risk" users

Although these case studies were developed in the domain of mental healthcare, they could be adapted to other domains.
