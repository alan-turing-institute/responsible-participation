# Community Practices and Pathways to Contribution

Thank you very much for considering to contribute to this repository. :tada:

## :busts_in_silhouette: Community Practices 

This special interest group is founded upon a belief and commitment to the value of responsible participation, both in terms of data science practices and also the organisation and practices of the special interest group itself.

In the context of this group, the term 'responsibility' is evoked to reflect an ongoing commitment to **reflective**, **deliberative**, **inclusive**, and **responsive** practices.

Responsible research and innovation (RRI) ([Owen e. al.](https://academic.oup.com/spp/article-abstract/39/6/751/1620724), doi: 10.1093/scipol/scs093) The following principles outline how these concepts can be put into practice in all of the group's activities.

The organisers and members of the special interest group are committed to:

- **Reflecting on our own ideas and ways of working through open and respectful conversation** 
- **Building consensus and resolving tensions through ethical deliberation**
- **Recognising and promoting the inherent value of diverse viewpoints by remaining inclusive and open in all our activities**
- **Promoting transparency to invite collaboration and being responsive to new opportunities to improve**
