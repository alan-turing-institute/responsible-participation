# :books: Curated Bibliography

The group has a shared Zotero library, which has been set-up with the goal of collectively creating a *curated list* of resources for those interested in responsible participation.

You can [view the group library here](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2746789/facilitating_responsible_participation_in_data_science/library).

To join the group library and contribute, you will need to request access. Please do this by sending an email with your Zotero username and email to cburr@turing.ac.uk

Please note the following guidelines before adding a resource:

1. Bibliographic information must be **usable and accurate**. Please do not just add a link without supporting information, such as author, publication year (etc.), and please check to make sure that the information is correct. While there is no minimum amount of information, please exercise good judgement. Zotero will do a good job of adding most information if you provide a DOI or ISBN when adding a resource. And, if something is missing, sites like [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) or [Google Books](https://books.google.com) can often help fill in the gaps. However, again, please check to make sure the information is correct.
2. Please add an accompanying note that explains why the resource is worth reading, and why it has been added. This is what will help make the list a **curated** set of resources, rather than a disorganised mess of readings.
3. If you are unfamiliar with Zotero—an open-source reference manager—a comprehensive set of documentation can be [found here](https://www.zotero.org/support/).
