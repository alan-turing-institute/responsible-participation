# Interest Group Blog

Coming Soon!

!!! question
    Do you want to write a blog post for the interest group and have it featured on our site? If so, please feel free to [get in touch](mailto:cburr@turing.ac.uk) with a very brief proposal (e.g., 100 words).
    The only requirement is that the post should be connected to the interest group's area of focus: facilitating responsible participation in data science.
