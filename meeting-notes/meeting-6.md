## Presentation

Malvika Sharan and Geogia Aitkenhead gave a presentation on Contextualising Research projects and Collaboration, and also introduced the [Autistica project](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/citizen-science-platform-autistica)â€”a project to co-develop a participatory, citizen-science platform investigating sensory processing and autism.

Slides for the presentation are available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/5724333)

The presentation also introduced a worksheet that has been designed by Malvika and Georgia to help researchers think about the contextualisation of their own research projects. As a way to help develop the worksheet and ensure that it supports reflection and contextaulisation, Malvika set up an issue on Github that can be used for discussion and feedback. 

The worksheet has been uploaded to [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1a1eP5d571HHWujH6VN7Ufcp4iQJeYO-Hry4UvE2k-dQ/edit?usp=sharing) for access.

SIG members were asked to take a look at the worksheet, use it in their own research, and then help Malvika and Georgia develop this excellent tool further.
